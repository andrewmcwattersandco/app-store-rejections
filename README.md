# app-store-rejections
A collection of App Store rejections

## Purpose
The App Store (Apple), and other digitial distribution stores do not operate in
your best interest. They will tax you more than your combined effective federal,
FICA, state, and local tax rate, reject your software for arbitrary reasons,
and even sometimes [Sherlock][^1] you.

This repository is a community-driven collection of App Store rejections put
together to encourage you to self-publish and to warn of the dangers of relying
on app marketplaces.
